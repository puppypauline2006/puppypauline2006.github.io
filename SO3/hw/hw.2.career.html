    <h3>Every kid has trouble deciding what kind of job they want to do. Like all the other kids, so did I.</h3>
    <h3>The first years of my life, up until kindergarden, I was not sure what I wanted to do, my friends and I were still trying to figure out what kinder meant. Especially why we were in a garden of them.</h3>
    <h3>After that, my parents engrained into my head. </h3>
    <h4><u>DOCTOR!!!<u></h4>
    <h4><u>DOCTOR!!!<u></h4>
    <h4><u>DOCTOR!!!<u></h4>
    <h4><u>DOCTOR!!!<u></h4>
    <h4><u>DOCTOR!!!<u></h4>
    <h3>However, I decided that animating would be for me last year!</h3>
    <h3>Finally, I accepted that my parents would only let me be a doctor, so that's what I plan on doing.</h3>
